# EllipsoidSLAM

## Introduction 引言
We propose a sparse object-level SLAM using Quadrics and Symmetry Properties for indoor environments. The algorithm is specially designed for mobile robots mounting an RGB-D camera. The algorithm takes bounding boxes generated from object detection and also the point cloud from the RGB-D frame to estimate the pose and occupy space of objects. Since ellipsoids are taken as the object representation, we name it EllipsoidSLAM.
我们使用二次曲面和对称性提供一种用于室内环境的稀疏物体级SLAM。该算法是专门为安装RGB-D摄像机的移动机器人设计的。该算法采用从物体检测中生成的边界框以及RGB-D帧中的点云来估计物体的姿态和占用空间。由于将椭球体（二次曲面）用作对象表示，因此将其命名为EllipsoidSLAM。

We have released a C++ implementation and a demo trajectory. We need to point out that this code is only a basic demo:
 * The core modules of Groundplane Extraction, Ellipsoid Estimation, and Symmetry Estimation are basic versions. They may not have full performance. Please see the paper for the complete framework. 
 * By default, only mapping is supported. If you want, it's possible to make simple changes to the Optimizer to enable the SLAM mode.
我们已经发布了C ++实现和演示轨迹。 我们需要指出的是，这段代码只是一个基本的演示：
  *地平面提取，椭球估计和对称估计的核心模块是基本版本。 他们不具有完美的性能。 请参阅论文以获取完整的框架。
  *默认情况下，仅支持映射。 如果需要，可以对优化器进行简单更改以启用SLAM模式。

## Codes
### Dependencies
The code has been tested on Ubuntu 16.04/18.04. The main dependencies are:

* OpenCV (2.4 tested)
* PCL 1.7+
* Pangolin
* g2o

For g2o, a modified version with SE3 transformation has been attached in the code. Use one simple command to compile it:
    
    $ sh install_g2o.sh

### Build
These commands will automatically generate the Core module and an interface for RGB-D dataset:

    $ mkdir build
    $ cd build
    $ cmake .. 
    $ make -j

if there occurs a linking problem, add the lib directory to the environment variable:

    export LD_LIBRARY_PATH={YOUR_SOUCE_CODE_PATH}/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH

## Demos

### TUM-Cabinet
The codes contain a trajectory of fr3_cabinet, which belongs to the TUM-RGB-D dataset. The bounding boxes are generated by YOLO. Just use one command to run the demo:

#### Run
    ./build/rgbd ./Example/param/TUM3.yaml ./Example/dataset/cabinet/

Please press Enter in the console to see the result of every frame. A visualization tool based on Pangolin is offered to visualize the point cloud, the symmetry planes, the ground plane, and the ellipsoids.

### Your Own Dataset
First, please run object detector like YOLO to generate bounding boxes and store the result as text files, with each line containing:

* id x1 y1 x2 y2 label probability instance

where, (x1,y1), (x2,y2) are the top-left, bottom-right corners. Multiple objects are supported, however, you need to manually specify the data association in [instance]. 

Second, keep the directory structure the same as the demo, then run the RGB-D interface. For the best effect, you may need to check the ground plane extraction and the point cloud segmentation.

## Notes
* All the important parameters could be adjusted in the .yaml file. See the comments in the file for details.

* The code is released under the BSD license. Feel free to adjust it as you like for research. Please cite our paper in your publications if you feel it helpful. 

* The code referred to several open-source SLAM codes, thanks to their great work: [ORBSLAM](https://github.com/raulmur/ORB_SLAM2), [CubeSLAM](https://github.com/shichaoy/cube_slam).
